IT-230 Final Project Repository

•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
This application was created for the user to register for various IT related courses. This was done through storing the user’s choices and maintaining a viable input validation system using branch statements. 
•	What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
I feel that what I did the best in this assignment was code clean up. In the final project in changing the first part to a string array, I felt that the output section was very messy. Changing this to output with one line of code felt more efficient and clean. 
•	Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
In regard to the UI the only decision I made in its design was where the validation text would go. I felt that it would be best go above the textbox displaying what courses the user selected. This is successful because that is naturally where the user’s eyes would go after selecting a course. 
•	How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
When debugging first I would see if the program was throwing any errors in the console or if there were red lines under parts of the code. If the code still was not doing what I knew it needed to I looked at names of variables or methods and made sure they matched up. After that it was mainly looking at branch logic to make sure they were doing what they were supposed to do. At every step though syntax was double and triple checked. 
•	Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
In the final project there was a need for a new textblock for the input validation output. Along with that changing the output code to a single line was also very innovative.
